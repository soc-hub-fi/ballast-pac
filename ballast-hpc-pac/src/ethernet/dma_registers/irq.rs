When an interrupt is raised and its corresponding bit in irq_mask is set, its corresponding bit in irq is set and the external IRQ line is asserted. The IRQ line is deasserted when all bits in the irq register are unset by a write by the processor. In other words, the external IRQ line is an OR-reduction of the irq register. Writes to the irq register cannot assert new interrupt requests; in other words, the value stored in the irq register is the old contents combined with the write value by a bitwise AND.\n\nThis register you can [`read`](crate::generic::Reg::read), [`write_with_zero`](crate::generic::Reg::write_with_zero), [`reset`](crate::generic::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::generic::Reg::write), [`modify`](crate::generic::Reg::modify).
